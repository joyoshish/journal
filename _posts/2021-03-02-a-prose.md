The house had always known silence. It settled into the corners of the rooms, slipped through the gaps in the wooden shutters, curled under the worn-out rug in the hallway. Even in the afternoons, when the Kolkata sun blazed outside, the light hesitated before stepping in. Dust floated in the slanted rays, thick and golden, yet the air inside remained cold, untouched. Somewhere in the distance, the tram bells rang, a hawker called out the price of ripe mangoes, and a stray dog barked at nothing in particular. The world moved on. But inside, time stood still. The walls, though lined with books and old paintings, felt barren, as if they had absorbed too much loneliness over the years, too many sighs that never turned into words. The furniture, the curtains, the old radio on the wooden shelf‚Äîthey all bore witness to a life that moved not in days and nights, but in echoes of things unspoken.  

Night brought with it a different kind of stillness‚Äîone that pressed against her skin, one that whispered in voices only she could hear. The darkness was not just an absence of light; it was something more. It stretched, expanded, reached out like an unseen hand, lingering in places it should not. The wooden almirah in the corner cast long, monstrous shadows, the folds of the mosquito net turned into shifting figures. The door, slightly ajar, seemed to breathe. It was not fear of what was outside that kept her frozen in bed, but the certainty that something waited within the darkness itself. The corridor leading to the bathroom seemed endless, the switchboard a distant island. Some nights, she held it in until her stomach ached. Some nights, she left the light on until dawn. And on nights when she did gather the courage to step out, she would hold her breath as she reached for the switch, as if exhaling would make the darkness aware of her presence.  

She had long learned that fear was not something you confessed. Not when you grew up in a house where emotions were luxuries, where expressions of weakness were met with hardened glances and rebukes disguised as wisdom. Her mother had once told her, *"Chhoto chhoto kothay chokher jol niye boshle chhotoi thakis"‚Äîif you cry over small things, you will always remain small.* So, she had swallowed her fears, along with her words, burying them in the hollow spaces between her ribs. It had become second nature, this silence, this careful restraint of feeling. She learned to smile just enough, to speak just enough, to exist just enough. And yet, some part of her always remained curled inward, like a child clutching her knees to her chest, waiting to be told it was safe to unfold.  

Even now, years later, she cried over things she could not name‚Äîover lost afternoons, over unspoken words, over the weight of days that stacked upon each other like old, moth-eaten saris locked in the trunk her grandmother never opened. She cried when she saw a bird struggle against the monsoon wind, when she overheard her mother sigh after folding clothes, when she found an old note in the pages of a forgotten book. It did not take much‚Äîjust a moment, a glance, a silence too deep. The tears came not in sobs but in quiet tremors, in the stillness of midnight when the world had stopped watching.

She had stopped expecting sleep to come. The bed was warm, the pillow soft, but nothing settled inside her. Mornings arrived not with the promise of something new but with the unbearable weight of another day that had to be lived through. She lay in bed long past the muriwala‚Äôs call, long past the clinking of her mother‚Äôs bangles in the kitchen, long past the world‚Äôs slow awakening. It was easier that way. The day could not disappoint her if she never stepped into it. The world outside moved in patterns she no longer recognized, or perhaps, no longer wanted to.  

Outside, the world had its own rhythm. The buses groaned under their weight, men in loosened ties wiped sweat from their foreheads as they rushed towards offices, fishmongers bargained in voices loud enough to drown out the chaos. She had once loved it all‚Äîthe disorder of Gariahat, the comfort of familiarity in the crowded mishti shops, the scent of burning camphor outside Dakshineshwar temple. She had once walked those streets with purpose, with laughter, with a heart that still believed in the small joys of existence. But that was a different life, a different girl. Now, even stepping onto the balcony felt like stepping into something foreign, something that no longer belonged to her. The sounds of the world had grown distant, not in volume, but in meaning.  

She kept everyone at a distance. Not because she did not care, but because she cared too much. Love, she had learned, was not gentle‚Äîit was a weight, a chain, a wound that never quite healed. She feared what she could do to the people she loved, how her sadness might spill over, stain them, change them. It was better this way, better to keep her words tucked away, her heart locked behind quiet nods and half-smiles. She had seen what love could do‚Äîhow it could hollow people out, how it could turn warmth into obligation, presence into mere habit. So she stayed behind the lines she had drawn, careful never to let anyone too close.  


Some people walk away, not because they do not love you, but because love alone is not enough. Because love, no matter how deeply felt, does not always hold people together.  


She had once read about *crown shyness*‚Äîthe way trees grew tall but never let their branches touch, as if fearing they might break each other. She had carried the term with her ever since. It explained everything. The careful distance, the spaces left untouched, the quiet protection disguised as solitude. She wondered if trees ever felt lonely.  

The days folded into each other, indistinguishable, repetitive. Her mother still moved through the house with practiced precision, folding clothes, dusting shelves, lighting the evening diya. Her father still sat by the window, newspaper in hand, eyes lost somewhere beyond the printed words. They lived together but separately, bound by routines, by duty, by something that once resembled love but had now hardened into obligation. She wondered if they ever looked at each other and remembered what it had been like before‚Äîbefore silence became their first language.  

And then, one night, the rain came differently.  

Not the quiet drizzle that usually melted into the city, but something wild, something desperate. It roared against the windows, banged against the tin roof of the neighbor‚Äôs shed, spilled over balconies, flooded the uneven pavement outside. The wind howled, rattling doors, seeping in through the cracks. It was as if the sky had finally given in, as if it could no longer hold itself together.  


She sat up, heart pounding. The darkness in the hallway was the same as always, but the storm outside felt like something else‚Äîsomething that understood. The air smelled thick with petrichor, heavy with the weight of things unspoken.  

For the first time in years, she placed her feet on the floor.  

The hallway stretched before her, shadowed but familiar. The light switch was still far. The darkness pulsed, waiting. But she did not stop.  

She walked.

> The night hums in a voice I have known forever,  
> soft as the breath of dying embers.  
> Darkness drapes itself over the world,  
> folding into the corners of my room,  
> leaving only shadows‚Äîsilent, waiting, still.  
>  
> The wind hums against the windowpane,  
> rain slides down like unwept tears.  
> Footsteps echo in the hollow corridors of my mind,  
> but no one comes, no one calls my name.  
> Only the floorboards remember the weight of my steps.  
>  
> There is a sadness that does not speak,  
> one that lingers in the spaces between words,  
> that rests in the hush before the storm,  
> that clings to the walls where hands once traced  
> stories that will never be retold.  
>  
> Some nights, the rain seeps through my ribs,  
> fills the cracks where warmth once lived,  
> and I let it, because what else is there?  
> What does a shadow do,  
> but follow and darken what it touches?  
>  
> Perhaps this is why I stay behind closed doors,  
> why my fingers tremble at the thought of reaching out.  
> I have known the weight of silence too well‚Äî  
> its heavy hush, its patient grief,  
> the quiet way it drowns everything in me.  
>  
> So let the night stretch endlessly,  
> let the rain sing its slow lament.  
> No one needs to see what the shadows do not say.
