            "content_text": "\n  \n  Melankoli – Edvard Munch (1891)\n\n\nThere’s a particular kind of restlessness that doesn’t come from lack. It’s quieter than hunger, slower than longing, and less dramatic than despair. It’s not about needing more or craving something specific. In fact, it often arrives just after everything is, more or less, okay.\n\nYou’re not in pain. You’re not chasing anything. You’re not grieving, nor are you growing. There’s food in the fridge, work is manageable, friendships are intact. You’re rested. You’re free. And yet, something gnaws — not loud, not sharp, but persistent. Like a dull vibration in the floor beneath you, or the soft hum of a refrigerator late at night. Unnameable. Inescapable.\n\nYou sit in a room — your room — and think: I want nothing. So why do I still feel like something is missing?\n\nThe Strange Shape of Spiritual Fatigue\n\nWhat we’re talking about is not boredom, exactly. Nor is it depression, though it sometimes brushes past it like a stranger in a hallway. This is something softer. Slippery. Something like spiritual fatigue.\n\nIt’s what happens when the machinery of want grinds to a halt, but the engine of mind keeps running. When you’ve decluttered, detoxed, unsubscribed, taken breaks, meditated, journaled, breathed deeply. You’ve cleared space. But no revelation arrives to fill it.\n\nAnd so you begin to wonder: was the craving — for success, for love, for clarity — at least giving shape to my days? Was wanting, however exhausting, anchoring me?\n\nNow, with stillness, you feel less like someone at peace and more like someone untethered.\n\nThe Mind’s Hum\n\nThere’s a sound your mind makes when it has no task. When you’re not actively planning, scrolling, escaping, fixing. It’s like a kind of low-frequency buzzing — thoughts without direction, emotions without texture.\n\nYou find yourself pacing rooms. Making tea you don’t really want. Checking apps without purpose. Rearranging pillows, then undoing the arrangement. You move your body not to achieve something, but to resist the weight of sitting still with your own interior fog.\n\nIt is not a crisis. It is not beauty. It is not productive. It just is.\n\nAnd it feels, somehow, intolerable.\n\nDesire as Structure\n\nMost of our lives are scaffolded by desire — obvious or subtle. Desire tells us what to wake up for, what to fight for, what to protect. When you strip it away — through achievement, exhaustion, disappointment, or enlightenment — you’re left with something rawer: formlessness.\n\nThe days blur because there’s no compass. There’s nothing to climb, and no reason to descend. Just flatness. A plain. An emotional middle-distance.\n\nSometimes, ironically, this arrives just when you’ve done everything right. You’ve meditated every day. You’ve left the toxic job. You’ve healed your trauma. You’ve simplified your routines. And now, here you are, in a clean apartment, full fridge, good lighting — feeling… what, exactly? Empty? Tired? Pointless?\n\nMaybe all the seeking gave us a narrative arc. And now the story has no obvious next chapter.\n\nThe Fear of Stillness\n\nThere’s a reason people run from stillness. It isn’t glamorous. It doesn’t photograph well. It doesn’t give you talking points or milestones. It just puts you in direct contact with your own humanness — not the curated kind, but the raw, quiet kind that lives between thoughts.\n\nStillness strips away the noise, but it also removes the illusion of clarity. You realize how many of your old desires were scaffolding, how much of your identity was stitched together from motion.\n\nAnd so we try to revive desire again. We make up new goals. Start projects we half-believe in. Chase upgrades, tweaks, improvements. Not because we want to — but because we can’t stand the silence.\n\nEnnui Isn’t Laziness\n\nIt’s tempting to dismiss all this as laziness or lack of gratitude. But ennui — the existential kind — isn’t about ingratitude or inaction. It’s about what remains when you strip away the usual distractions and find that you still don’t feel full.\n\nIt’s a deep fatigue of the spirit — not because it’s overwhelmed, but because it has no clear object to land on. It’s like reaching for something in the dark that isn’t there, over and over, without knowing why you’re reaching.\n\nYou start asking strange, quiet questions:\n\n\n  What is this life really for?\n  Why do I need everything to have a purpose?\n  What if there’s nothing to fix, but I still don’t feel whole?\n\n\nLearning to Sit With the Fog\n\nThe first instinct is always to solve. To problem-solve the feeling. But this is not a problem in the traditional sense. It’s more like a weather pattern. You learn to sit in the fog. To notice the shape of the mist instead of waiting for the sun.\n\nSometimes you light a candle not to change the mood, but just to bear witness to it. You walk, not to arrive anywhere, but to feel your feet touch the ground. You read not to escape, but to remember how words used to stir you.\n\nThe point isn’t to generate desire again. It’s to honor the space where desire once lived.\n\nWhat If This, Too, Is Living?\n\nMaybe this state — this absence of craving, this quiet ache — is not a failure, but a kind of threshold. A recalibration. A spiritual molting.\n\nMaybe it’s okay to have days, weeks, seasons where nothing shines. Where nothing calls. Where your only task is to stay soft. To notice. To endure gently.\n\nMaybe you’re not broken. Maybe you’re just in between selves.\n\nAnd maybe the hum you feel is not emptiness at all — but the soul, slowly tuning to a quieter frequency.\n\n\n⬩⬩⬩\n\n\nIf you’re here — in this place — you’re not alone. Many of us have been here, are here, will be here again. There’s no productivity metric for spiritual fatigue. No app for restlessness of the soul.\n\nSo give yourself a little credit. For noticing. For naming it. For not rushing to patch it.\n\nSometimes the most radical act is not to escape the fog, but to walk slowly through it with your eyes open.\n\n",

            "content_text": "\n  “Man is not what he thinks he is, he is what he hides.” — André Malraux\n\n\nThere’s a peculiar intimacy in being known by a machine. It starts quietly. A new playlist called Discover Weekly is generated. A film you weren’t planning to watch gets suggested late one night. A product you’d never considered appears in your feed, and strangely — it resonates. Over time, these nudges coalesce into something eerily precise. The algorithm, you begin to suspect, knows. But what does it know — and how?\n\nIn a world increasingly mediated by recommendation engines — from Netflix to Spotify, YouTube to Amazon, Tinder to Twitter — the question becomes not just whether these systems understand our tastes, but whether they perceive parts of us we’ve left unexamined. Can an algorithm uncover unconscious desires? Can your digital shadow whisper truths that your conscious self avoids?\n\nTo explore this, we must first understand what these models are actually doing, and then confront the uncomfortable possibility that they may be not just predicting your preferences — but revealing you to yourself.\n\nI. The Mathematics of You\n\nAt the heart of most recommendation systems lies collaborative filtering. It works by examining your behavior — the movies you watch, the products you browse, the songs you loop late at night — and correlating it with others who behave similarly. If person A and person B both liked movies X and Y, and person A also liked movie Z, the system assumes person B might enjoy Z too.\n\nIt sounds simple, and in many ways it is. But the simplicity belies its potency. As the data set grows and behavior becomes more granular (likes, skips, dwell time, click-through rate, scrolling speed), the patterns deepen. Recommendation engines begin to find connections not just between products, but between patterns of attention, modes of desire, types of longing.\n\nThe result is that over time, these systems can not only suggest things you’ve enjoyed in the past, but anticipate experiences you hadn’t even known you were seeking. They build a portrait — not of who you say you are, but who you are in action. The part of you that clicks when no one is watching.\n\nII. The Repressed User\n\nThis brings us to an intriguing psychological territory. In psychoanalysis, the unconscious is not just the forgotten — it’s the forbidden, the repressed, the inconvenient. Freud suggested that much of who we are lives beneath our awareness, shaping our behavior from the shadows.\n\nWhat happens, then, when algorithms trained on our behavioral residue begin to surface patterns we haven’t admitted to ourselves?\n\nPerhaps you’ve never explicitly searched for meditative music. But after a few sleepless nights and extended stares into the ceiling, a calming playlist appears — and it soothes you. You didn’t know you needed it. Or perhaps you’ve never thought of yourself as someone who would enjoy romantic period dramas, yet a few late-night binges suggest otherwise. The algorithm doesn’t judge. It doesn’t moralize. It reflects.\n\nThese quiet revelations — made through data — bypass the layers of identity we construct for ourselves. They reveal a different self, less filtered, less defended. One might even say: more true.\n\nIII. Algorithms as Psychoanalysts\n\nThere’s something almost therapeutic about the algorithmic gaze. Like a modern analyst, the system watches without interruption, without reaction. It waits. It notes. It learns. It doesn’t care about your job title, your beliefs, your curated image. It cares about what you do.\n\nThis might be why algorithmic recommendations often feel so eerily intimate. They tap into the Freudian idea of parapraxis — the so-called “slips” that reveal hidden thoughts. But instead of a slip of the tongue, we get a click. A pause. A scroll. A return.\n\nAnd like a good psychoanalyst, the algorithm draws no immediate conclusions. It aggregates. It models. It suggests. And in the process, it reveals.\n\nOf course, it does all of this not in the service of healing, but monetization. The aim is not integration of the psyche, but optimization of attention. But perhaps, in its cold neutrality, the algorithm can still do something our friends, families, or even our therapists cannot: observe us without expectation.\n\nIV. The Problem of Knowing Too Much\n\nBut this also opens a troubling door. If the algorithm knows us better than we know ourselves, who does that make us?\n\nThere’s a concept in philosophy called epistemic humility — the recognition that our knowledge is always partial, always shaped by biases and blind spots. The recommendation engine, by contrast, is immodestly confident. It watches everything, remembers everything, compares us to everyone.\n\nIt’s not hard to imagine a future where the algorithm becomes our oracle. Not just suggesting music or movies, but books to read, careers to pursue, partners to love. Already, some dating apps use collaborative filtering to match people based on preference behaviors rather than bios. What happens when a machine learns that your subconscious preference is for people unlike the ones you think you’re attracted to?\n\nCould an algorithm nudge you toward life paths your conscious mind would reject — but your behavior secretly yearns for? Could it become a quiet force guiding your existential choices?\n\nAnd if so, would you trust it?\n\nV. The Double Bind\n\nThere’s a paradox here. On the one hand, we fear being reduced to data. On the other, we’re seduced by the comfort of being known. We want personalization — the right song, the right film, the right partner — but we flinch when the machine gets too close.\n\nWhy? Perhaps because these systems trespass into areas we’ve cordoned off. Desires we’ve dismissed. Tastes we’ve repressed. They offer mirrors without frames — glimpses of the raw material of our psyches, unshaped by ego.\n\nBut is this ‘knowing’ real? Or is it just correlation masquerading as insight?\n\nThis is the epistemological riddle of AI: it doesn’t understand why you like what you like. It doesn’t grasp meaning. It doesn’t intuit story. It only models pattern. It doesn’t know you — it knows the data shadow you leave behind.\n\nAnd yet, that shadow may be more honest than your curated light.\n\nVI. Who’s in Control?\n\nUltimately, we must ask: who is steering whom?\n\nWhen Netflix queues up a title you didn’t know you’d love, is that free will or gentle manipulation? When Spotify revives a forgotten genre from your childhood, is it giving you what you want, or reinforcing a nostalgic loop?\n\nThe power of recommendation systems lies not in coercion, but in subtle shaping. They are not dictators but gardeners, pruning and feeding certain habits over others. And slowly, perhaps imperceptibly, they mold our internal landscape.\n\nYou might still choose — but from a menu they’ve designed.\n\nThis doesn’t mean we’re doomed to be passive consumers of prediction. It means we must become more conscious of our unconscious digital selves. The ones that linger in late-night browsing, in playlists created by skipping, in rabbit holes of content clicked through half-asleep.\n\nVII. Becoming Aware of the Machine Within\n\nSo what do we do with all this?\n\nMaybe the answer lies not in resisting the algorithm, but in using it as a tool for reflection. Watch what it suggests. Track what it thinks you want. Let its predictions become a journal of your unsaid self.\n\nNotice the songs it brings forward after heartbreak. The kinds of people it presents to you on dating apps. The ads that follow you. Ask why.\n\nIn doing so, you might begin to glimpse not the machine’s intention — but your own.\n\nVIII. In the End, a Kind of Mirror\n\nPerhaps recommendation engines are not oracles, not puppeteers, not analysts — but mirrors. Strange, data-polished, pattern-hungry mirrors that show us not who we pretend to be, but who we might actually be becoming.\n\nThey reflect our tendencies, magnify our habits, and sometimes — if we dare to look closely — they reveal desires we’ve buried under layers of narrative.\n\nSo next time the algorithm gets it too right, don’t look away. Ask yourself:\n\nIs this what I want?\n\nOr is this what I’ve never admitted wanting — until now?\n\n&mdash; ✦ &mdash;\n\n\n\nIf you were to train a model solely on your late-night choices, what kind of person would emerge? Would you recognize them? Would you fear them? Or — quietly — would you envy them for their honesty?\n\nAfter all, the machine only learns what we teach it.\nBut sometimes, in teaching, we uncover the deepest lessons of all.\n\n",

When Spotify revives a forgotten genre from your childhood, is it giving you what you want, or reinforcing a nostalgic loop?</p>\n\n<p>The power of recommendation systems lies not in coercion, but in <em>subtle shaping</em>. They are not dictators but gardeners, pruning and feeding certain habits over others. And slowly, perhaps imperceptibly, they mold our internal landscape.</p>\n\n<p>You might still choose — but from a menu they’ve designed.</p>\n\n<p>This doesn’t mean we’re doomed to be passive consumers of prediction. It means we must become more conscious of our unconscious digital selves. The ones that linger in late-night browsing, in playlists created by skipping, in rabbit holes of content clicked through half-asleep.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vii-becoming-aware-of-the-machine-within\">VII. Becoming Aware of the Machine Within</h3>\n\n<p>So what do we do with all this?</p>\n\n<p>Maybe the answer lies not in resisting the algorithm, but in using it as a tool for reflection. Watch what it suggests. Track what it thinks you want. Let its predictions become a journal of your unsaid self.</p>\n\n<p>Notice the songs it brings forward after heartbreak. The kinds of people it presents to you on dating apps. The ads that follow you. Ask why.</p>\n\n<p>In doing so, you might begin to glimpse not the machine’s intention — but your own.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"viii-in-the-end-a-kind-of-mirror\">VIII. In the End, a Kind of Mirror</h3>\n\n<p>Perhaps recommendation engines are not oracles, not puppeteers, not analysts — but mirrors. Strange, data-polished, pattern-hungry mirrors that show us not who we pretend to be, but who we might actually be becoming.</p>\n\n<p>They reflect our tendencies, magnify our habits, and sometimes — if we dare to look closely — they reveal desires we’ve buried under layers of narrative.</p>\n\n<p>So next time the algorithm gets it <em>too right</em>, don’t look away. Ask yourself:</p>\n\n<p>Is this what I want?</p>\n\n<p>Or is this what I’ve never admitted wanting — until now?</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 2rem;\">&mdash; ✦ &mdash;</p>\n\n<!-- <div style=\"height: 4px;\"></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">⬩⬩⬩</p>\n<div style=\"height: 4px;\"></div>\n -->\n\n<p>If you were to train a model solely on your late-night choices, what kind of person would emerge? Would you recognize them? Would you fear them? Or — quietly — would you envy them for their honesty?</p>\n\n<p>After all, the machine only learns what we teach it.\nBut sometimes, in teaching, we uncover the deepest lessons of all.</p>\n\n",

            "content_text": "\n  \n  Wheatfield with Crows – Vincent van Gogh (July 1890)\n\n\nUnder skies streaked with violent shades of amber and cobalt, amidst wheat fields murmuring secrets to an eternal sun, wandered a solitary figure. His steps quick yet hesitant, eyes tracing invisible horizons, fingers restless with an unspoken yearning. He was a soul chasing beauty as others pursued power or wealth, his heart always poised at the edge of a turbulent ocean.\n\nHe came into this world quietly, born in the pastoral calm of a small village that embedded itself permanently into his dreams. Unaware of the gentle melancholy trailing him like twilight shadows, he grew in solitude, his childhood tinted with grays interrupted by flashes of luminous imagination. He walked often, absorbing sights and sensations he could not yet voice.\n\nHis early years were tinged by the quiet of libraries and the solemnity of churches, places that whispered comfort yet echoed his loneliness. Books offered temporary escapes, but they never fully bridged the gulf between himself and the world outside. Nature became his truest companion—trees, fields, and skies listened without judgment, always present, always patient.\n\nAdulthood found him restless, yearning to connect deeply but forever feeling alienated, his earnest words misunderstood, his passion misread as intensity too raw to comfort. False starts plagued his journey, first as a dealer of others’ creations, then as a preacher of truths few wished to hear. He preached fervently, pouring his heart into every sermon, yet his message fell on ears unwilling or unable to hear. Isolation wrapped around him like a cloak, silent and unseen, thickening with each disappointed glance and dismissive whisper.\n\nThe revelation of art came late, bursting upon him with undeniable force, transforming into a lifeline to anchor his turbulent spirit. Each stroke upon the canvas was a fervent whisper, a plea for understanding, reflecting not just the landscapes and faces before him, but the deep, raw echoes of his own inner universe.\n\nCities shaped and reshaped him. Paris, with its luminous vibrancy, ignited his palette, but the relentless noise frayed his fragile nerves. He roamed streets alive with color, observing, absorbing, and struggling to articulate the kaleidoscope of sensations overwhelming him. Seeking refuge, he fled southward, toward warmth and quieter skies, nurturing dreams of shared creativity, companions who might understand and ease his encroaching solitude.\n\nUnder southern skies, his paintings ignited—sunflowers blazing against blue heavens, café lamps glowing softly in indigo nights, each scene vibrating intensely with life. His canvases became symphonies of color and movement, capturing moments of exquisite beauty and subtle sadness intertwined. Yet loneliness, ever-present, deepened sharply after a friend’s departure, plunging him into darker turmoil. A desperate act, misunderstood by those around him, marked a cry for help lost amidst whispers and scandal.\n\nConfined behind asylum walls, he found paradoxical freedom. Painting became rhythm, solace, and escape. Cypress trees twisted skyward in flames, olive groves swirled restlessly, stars danced in ecstatic spirals bridging earth and heaven. His canvases spoke in whispers and screams, articulating the emotions language could scarcely touch. In solitude, his imagination flourished, but so too did the shadows within him, deepening and sharpening, relentlessly present.\n\nHis world, painted vivid yet fleeting, carried always an undertone of fragility—a poignant acknowledgment of life’s impermanence. Brushstrokes bold and textured reached out, craving touch, seeking connection. Each piece became a silent conversation, intimate and raw, yet he remained unheard. As his work deepened in beauty, so grew the weight of internal voices whispering inadequacy and failure.\n\nA quiet village embraced his final chapter, witnessing both remarkable productivity and eventual collapse. Under the care of a melancholy physician who mirrored his sadness, he painted feverishly—stormy skies above trembling churches, golden wheat fields mourning unseen sorrows, portraits etched with profound vulnerability, each carrying the silent weight of farewell.\n\nOne wheat field beneath a darkening sky became his silent elegy, capturing foreboding peace, reflecting his paradoxical existence. Here, amidst swaying gold, he took a final act toward liberation, a desperate gesture to escape relentless shadows. Even as life ebbed painfully away, his spirit remained as restless as his brush, still searching for elusive peace.\n\nOnly after he slipped quietly from life into his brother’s gentle embrace did the world awaken to the brilliance of his vision. His canvases, once overlooked or misunderstood, echoed with humanity’s profound depth, resonating empathy and love too late to save him.\n\nIn death, his legacy emerged quietly, growing steadily from whispers into voices raised in awe. His struggles and solitude became symbols of the universal human condition—the search for meaning, the ache for understanding, the desperate need for love and acceptance. His paintings no longer mere images but narratives, poetry crafted in vibrant color, eternal reminders of the beauty and fragility of existence.\n\nHis legacy transcends mere artistry—it’s a tale of beauty interwoven with sorrow, passion shadowed by loneliness. A prophet unheard in life, whose heart poured freely onto canvas, he gifted humanity reflections of its fragile, beautiful struggle.\n\nToday, beneath museum lights or captured in countless reproductions, his paintings continue whispering truths about life’s struggle and joy, loss and quiet hope. Visitors gaze, wondering silently at the identity behind the brush, the soul who bore such agony and yet managed to capture unparalleled beauty. The solitary wanderer beneath swirling skies endures, forever etched into collective consciousness—not just as an artist, but as a poignant embodiment of humanity’s ceaseless longing for meaning, connection, and the fragile light that pierces darkness.\n\n",

            "content_text": "There exists a peculiar kind of absence, one that does not stem from the lack of people but from the lack of connection. It is the silence that lingers after an achievement, the weight that follows a burst of laughter, the quiet that grows when emotions are swallowed whole. It is the space left behind when milestones, triumphs, and sorrows remain unspoken, with no one to receive them.\n\nAt first, the absence is subtle. A promotion at work, an award, or even a personal milestone—things that should spark celebration—become muted events. The initial rush of joy crashes into the realization that there is no one whose eyes will light up with shared pride. The champagne remains unopened, the dinner unplanned, the phone call never made. What should be an exhilarating moment instead becomes a quiet acknowledgment of self-worth.\n\nBut human nature thrives on exchange, on the simple act of being understood. Success, when kept to oneself, loses its luster. It is like a song played in an empty hall, the echoes bouncing back without anyone to absorb their beauty. Why does joy feel so incomplete in solitude? Because emotions gain depth through validation. When happiness is shared, it is reinforced, amplified, made real. When it is withheld, it begins to erode, reduced to a whisper of its former self.\n\nYet, it is not only joy that shifts under the weight of silence. Sorrow, when left unspoken, turns into an unbearable burden. Pain is meant to be divided, lightened by the presence of another. When adversity strikes and there is no one to lean on, it is not just the event itself that wounds—it is the cruel realization that the weight must be carried alone. Without a voice to acknowledge suffering, the world itself seems indifferent.\n\nSome attempt to rationalize this silence, convincing themselves that self-sufficiency is strength. “I don’t need anyone to be happy,” they say. “I can handle my problems on my own.” And perhaps, to a certain extent, this is true. Independence is valuable, resilience admirable. But the mind’s arguments do not always align with the heart’s desires. There is a difference between existing within oneself and truly living.\n\nOne could fill a room with noise, surround themselves with people, and still feel like an island. Because connection is not merely proximity; it is recognition. A shared glance, a knowing smile, a moment of mutual understanding—these are the things that give weight to existence. Without them, the world becomes a series of passing shadows, events unfolding like scenes in a play with no audience.\n\nA cruel irony emerges. In a world of billions, in an age of instant communication, one would assume that connection is effortless. Yet, having thousands of contacts in a phonebook does not guarantee that there is someone who truly listens. Social media allows the broadcasting of every detail, but it does not ensure that anyone genuinely cares. Likes and comments are poor substitutes for the depth of a real conversation, the understanding in a glance.\n\nThere is an ancient parable, rarely told, of a man who spent his life chasing echoes. He was neither king nor beggar, neither scholar nor fool—only a man who longed to be understood. He traveled across lands, whispering his thoughts into the wind, speaking his joys to the mountains, confessing his sorrows to the sea. But the wind only scattered his words, the mountains stood unmoved, and the sea swallowed his grief without reply.\n\nOne evening, as he walked through a nameless city, he met an old woman who sat at the edge of a fountain, tracing invisible patterns on the stone. Without introduction, she spoke:\n\n“You seek someone who will hear you. But you mistake hearing for understanding.”\n\nStartled, he asked her what she meant. She gestured toward the water, where ripples spread from the place where a single leaf had fallen.\n\n“Words, like ripples, reach far. But not all who hear their movement understand their origin. You can scream your truth to the world, but it will only be noise to those who do not recognize its shape.”\n\nHe wanted to ask more, but when he turned, she was gone—as if she had never been there at all.\n\nThat night, he sat by the fountain and watched the water, wondering: was it the world that refused to listen, or had he simply never found the one who could recognize the pattern in his ripples?\n\nAnd so, what does one do when they find themselves in this state? When victories feel hollow, when sorrow lingers without release, when everyday moments pass unnoticed?\n\nSome retreat inward, accepting the silence as fate. They become their own confidants, their own celebrants. They develop rituals—perhaps journaling their successes, whispering their happiness into the void, standing before a mirror and telling their reflection the things they wish they could say to another. These are coping mechanisms, not solutions, but they offer a semblance of relief.\n\nOthers seek out new connections, yearning for someone who will receive their unspoken words, someone who will be the audience to their unperformed symphony. This is an act of bravery, for it requires vulnerability. To open oneself to another is to risk rejection, to risk disappointment. But it is also the only way to break free from the quiet suffocation of isolation.\n\nThen there are those who, in the absence of human connection, turn to art, literature, music—avenues where emotions are immortalized and shared across time. A writer may pour their unsaid thoughts into pages, hoping that somewhere, someday, someone will read and understand. A musician may compose melodies to capture the essence of their unspoken emotions, transforming them into beauty. In this way, connection transcends physical presence; it becomes something that outlives the moment, something eternal.\n\nPerhaps the most profound realization in all of this is that love—be it romantic, platonic, or familial—is not just about presence. It is about witness. To care for someone is to bear witness to their life, to acknowledge their existence in its fullness. To be unseen, unheard, is to exist in a world where moments slip away without meaning, where even the most profound experiences feel fleeting.\n\nYet, one must also confront a sobering truth: there will be moments in life where silence is inevitable. Not every success will be celebrated with another. Not every tear will be wiped away by a caring hand. And in those moments, one must learn the delicate balance between seeking connection and finding peace within oneself. The art of living is not just about sharing joy but also about learning to hold it in one’s heart without needing external validation. It is about grieving without being consumed, about rejoicing without an audience.\n\nBut if the chance to share arises, if a person who truly listens enters one’s life, it is a gift beyond measure. For to be understood, even once, even briefly, is to break the silence of the universe, to leave an imprint upon another’s soul. And so, even as one navigates the quiet, there remains a hope—silent but steadfast—that one day, the unspoken will be heard, and the unseen will be known.\n\nUntil then, the river flows, carrying time forward. And in its reflection, if one looks closely enough, they might just find a glimpse of themselves, waiting to be understood.\n",

            "content_text": "It is not a fleeting rush of passion, nor is it an ever-burning fire of effortless devotion. It is not the stuff of fairytales, where the magic never fades and the world conspires to keep two hearts intertwined without struggle. No, it is a choice. It is a decision made over and over again, through the mundane and the extraordinary, through laughter and silence, through certainty and doubt. It is the quiet philosophy of devotion, the art of being present in an ever-changing world.\n\nIn the beginning, it seems like a force beyond control. It sweeps in with intensity, with longing, with a sense of completeness that feels almost unreal. Conversations stretch late into the night, each word revealing new depths of connection. Every glance carries an electric charge, every touch a promise. The world feels lighter, as if everything is colored by the presence of another. But time is unrelenting, and the very things that once felt novel begin to settle into familiarity. What once thrilled now becomes routine.

Just as the river does not resist the changing seasons but adapts, flows, deepens—so too does the heart when it chooses to stay. The true measure of commitment is not in the ease of its beginning but in the strength of its continuation. To stay is to choose—to choose patience when tempers flare, to choose kindness when words could wound, to choose presence when absence might be easier.\n\nThere will be days when warmth feels distant, when frustration overshadows tenderness, when exhaustion makes effort seem like a burden. There will be moments of doubt, when the heart questions what the mind once knew so certainly. And yet, it is in these moments that resilience is tested, and in these moments that the decision must be made anew. Not because it is always easy, but because it is always worth it. After all, is it not the nature of all things meaningful to demand endurance? The grandest mountains are not shaped in a day, nor are the most profound bonds.\n\n\n  \n  The Kiss – Gustav Klimt (1907–1908)\n\n\nIt is not an escape from life’s difficulties; it is the place where they are shared. It is not a fair-weather presence, but a refuge in the storm. It is not about grand gestures or poetic confessions, but about the quiet, unseen acts of devotion—the small sacrifices, the daily affirmations, the unwavering presence. It is in the making of coffee before the other wakes, in the remembering of details others would overlook, in the reaching out even when hurt lingers. It is found in the holding on, in the choosing again and again to walk this path together, even when it winds through shadows. It is the embodiment of an unspoken philosophy—the belief that the truest form of care is not found in mere words but in the spaces between them.\n\nSociety has taught that what is real should be effortless, that when it ceases to thrill, it has ceased to exist. But this is a misunderstanding, a deception that leaves many searching for something that was never lost—only transformed. It does not vanish with time; it evolves. What begins with passion matures into something deeper, something stronger. It is no longer about the chase but about the companionship, no longer about discovery but about understanding. It is no longer just about how someone makes you feel but about who they are and the life you choose to build with them. The philosopher once mused that we do not step into the same river twice; just as the river changes, so do we. Yet some rivers, some journeys, remain worth traversing despite the inevitable transformation.\n\nTo care deeply is to accept imperfection—not just in another, but in oneself. It is to see flaws and remain, to witness change and adapt, to recognize that no one remains the same person they were at the beginning. It is not stagnant; it moves, it shifts, it requires tending. And that tending is a choice. To continue, to forgive, to appreciate, to stay.\n\nIn a world that values convenience, it is easy to discard what no longer feels effortless. It is easy to believe that difficulty is a sign of failure rather than an opportunity for growth. But the depth of any true bond is not found in ease—it is found in perseverance. It is about the choice to stand beside someone, not just in moments of joy but in moments of uncertainty. It is about seeing through temporary struggles to the foundation that remains strong beneath. It is about understanding that just as the moon waxes and wanes, the tide rises and recedes, all that is real moves in cycles—yet always returns.\n\nAt its core, it is not found in fleeting moments of passion but in the enduring decision to care. It is in the work, in the willingness to mend what frays, in the patience to wait for storms to pass. It is in the trust that even on the hardest days, there is still something worth holding on to. It is not just a feeling—it is a choice. A choice made not once, but a thousand times over a lifetime. A quiet philosophy, a whisper in the wind, a decision made in the silence of the soul.\n\n",
            "content_html": "<p>It is not a fleeting rush of passion, nor is it an ever-burning fire of effortless devotion. It is not the stuff of fairytales, where the magic never fades and the world conspires to keep two hearts intertwined without struggle. No, it is a choice.

            "title": "Like Rain on the Platform",
            "content_text": "I’ll be honest with you. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Maybe nothing. Maybe everything. Maybe this is just what it means to carry someone like a ghost stitched to your skin. Maybe this is how some loves live—like background radiation: invisible, persistent, altering you without ever asking permission. Maybe sadness is the rent I pay for having known her at all. I’ve tried to make peace with it. With her absence. With this hollow echo that used to be a heart. But peace isn’t quiet. Not for me. Peace is a war that never ends—every day I wake up hoping the battle is over, and every night I fall asleep in the arms of grief again, like a fool who can’t quit the lover that keeps wrecking him.\n\nI get sad over her. Of course I do. But it’s not just sadness. It’s this raw, throbbing thing that moves through my bones like a second pulse. It’s anger and longing and madness and shame. It’s the way a song can break me for no reason at all, or how seeing a couple laughing on the street makes me clench my fists until my nails mark crescent moons into my palms. And it’s the silence—the memory of our silences. The soft kind. The kind only two introverts understand. We didn’t need noise. We didn’t fill the air with meaningless chatter. Our world was built in the quiet—tiny glances, a shared smile, hands brushing by accident and then staying just a second too long. Little human touches that made up our entire universe. We talked too little, maybe, but in that little, everything was contained. Every heartbeat. Every unsaid thing.\n\nThere’s this image I can’t shake. A train platform. Rain falling in quiet. Me, standing there like a ghost watching her disappear through the fog—except there’s no train. She just dissolves into the air. And the rain keeps falling, like the sky knows something I don’t. That’s what this grief feels like. Like rain on the platform. Constant. Cold. Uninvited. But somehow, weirdly sacred. Like the last place we were both real. Like the quiet space where we used to exist without needing words.\n\nSometimes I wonder if it ever really happened—us. If I didn’t just imagine the entire thing out of loneliness and a desperate craving for meaning. But no. I remember how her eyes looked when she was tired but still smiled. You don’t fabricate moments like that. But the mind—oh, the mind—it’s a cruel little artist. It adds brushstrokes where there were none. It embellishes. It folds time into itself until everything feels like yesterday and also like another life.\n\nAnd then comes the guilt. The terrible, acidic guilt. Because maybe I was the one who wasn’t enough. Maybe I was too much. Maybe I said the wrong things. Maybe I didn’t fight hard enough. Or maybe I fought too much. Maybe I just broke in all the ways she couldn’t fix. People don’t leave perfection. People leave storms. And I was a hurricane in a body trying to learn how to be a garden.\n\nI think about her when I shouldn’t. In grocery aisles. In elevators. When I’m brushing my teeth. When I’m lying to friends and saying I’m fine. I see her face in strangers and my stomach drops, like my body’s trying to outrun the memory. I look for her in all the wrong places—old texts, old photos, songs.\n\n&mdash; ✦ &mdash;\n\nGrief, I’ve come to learn, is not linear. It’s a spiral staircase. Some days you feel like you’re rising above it, breathing clean air. And then something—an accidental scent, a slip of sunlight through your window, a laugh that sounds too much like hers—pulls you back down, and suddenly you’re drowning in the same tears you thought you’d dried months ago. But the past isn’t a museum. You can’t just visit it when you feel lonely. The past bites. It claws. It begs you to stay, then kicks you out before you can remember what happiness tasted like. And still, I go back. Still, I sit in the ruins of us like they’re sacred. Because maybe they are. Because maybe that’s the only place where we still exist—as a half-finished prayer.\n\nShe’s everywhere and nowhere. That’s the curse. It’s not that she left. It’s that she lingers. Like smoke after a fire. Like perfume on a pillow. Like a dream you almost remember. I talk to her when no one’s around. I whisper things I never had the courage to say when she was with me. Back then, the words stayed stuck behind my teeth. We were both that way—two people constantly waiting for the other to speak first, to admit a feeling, to ask the big questions. But maybe we didn’t need words. Maybe our love was made of stillness. Of presence. Of sitting next to each other and letting the silence stretch—not because we had nothing to say, but because saying it would’ve broken the spell.\n\nSome nights, I go full madman. I write letters I’ll never send. I pace the room muttering her name like it’s a spell. I pick fights with myself in the mirror, hurling blame and grief and half-truths until I’m too exhausted to stand. And then, like clockwork, I sit on the floor and cry like a child. Not because I want her back—no, that would be too clean. I cry because I miss the person I was when she loved me. I cry because I don’t know who the fuck I am without that reflection. What do you do when your sense of self is stitched together by someone who is no longer here? When the best version of you existed only in the eyes of someone who’s stopped looking? There are no self-help books for that kind of emptiness. Only long nights. Only rain.\n\nIt’s embarrassing, really. This level of attachment. Of devotion. Of devastation. People tell you to move on. People hand you clichés like painkillers: “Time heals,” they say. “You’ll find someone better.” Fuck that. Time doesn’t heal. Time hides the wounds under scar tissue until they start to itch again at 3 a.m. And I don’t want someone better. I wanted her. In all her mess and magic and maddening humanity.\n\nBut love isn’t a democracy. You don’t get to vote on someone else’s leaving. And fate? Fate is a bastard. A cruel little child pulling wings off butterflies, just to see what happens. If there’s a god, he’s laughing. Sometimes I imagine alternative timelines. Like a crazy person. One where we said the right things. One where I held her hand just a second longer. One where we made it. I know it’s delusional. But grief turns reason into a puzzle missing all the corner pieces. And sometimes the only thing that keeps me breathing is the fantasy that somewhere, somehow, she still thinks of me too.\n\nAnd so I get sad. Over her. Over us. Over everything we were and everything we’ll never be. And maybe that sadness is the only way I get to be close to her now. Through grief, I trace her shape in the dark. Through ache, I hear her laughter. Through sorrow, I feel her fingers lace with mine one last time. Maybe I’m broken. Maybe I’m unlovable. Maybe I’m addicted to the pain because it’s the only thing left that still feels like love. But if this is madness, let me have it. If this is weakness, let me drown in it. Because the truth is—I’d rather be haunted by her than healed without her.\n\nAnd so here I am, again. Back on that platform. The rain hasn’t stopped. It probably never will. But I stay. I stay because it’s the closest I can get to her. Because every drop feels like her memory touching my skin. Because even in her absence, this is where I still love her—in the silence, in the waiting, in the rain.\n\nThere’s a kind of ritual to all this now. Like my body remembers the choreography of missing her. I rehearse whole dialogues with her—versions where I’m funnier, wiser, braver. Where I finally say the thing that would’ve made her stay. But life isn’t theatre. You don’t get rehearsals. You only get silence after a slammed door.\n\nSometimes I think about reaching out. Just a message. Just to ask how she’s been. But I don’t. Not because I don’t want to. God, I want to. But because I know what I’d be doing: digging my own grave a little deeper. Hoping her voice might become a rope I could climb out with, when really, it’d only pull me further under. Missing her is a sickness. And I’m tired of relapsing.\n\nStill, I collect her like sea glass. Tiny shards of her in everyday moments. She’s there and not there. Like static. Like a frequency I can’t tune out. And I’ve come to live with it. With this buzzing, aching frequency of her. They say love is a shelter. But some loves are storms. And even months later, I’m still pulling twigs from my hair, still wringing out my soaked clothes, still wondering if any part of me was ever dry again.\n\nFriends don’t get it. They offer condolences like weather reports. “Storm’s passed now, huh?” And I nod. Because what else can I say? That the rain is inside me now? That I walk with it? That I’ve grown to like the sound of it?\n\nThere’s a certain beauty in sadness, if you squint. A kind of sacredness in carrying love after it’s gone. In lighting candles for someone who will never see them. In holding space for a ghost you named home. I don’t expect anyone to understand it. I barely do. But I know this: forgetting her would be a second death. And I’m not ready to bury her twice.\n\nSo I keep her close. In raindrops. In silence. In memories soft as mist and sharp as glass. I let the sadness have me. I let it build shrines in my chest. And every once in a while, when the world is quiet and the night is heavy, I swear I feel her beside me. Not like a haunting—but like a breath. Like warmth. Like the part of me that still believes we were real. And maybe that’s what love becomes, after the wreckage. A quiet ache you make a life around. A rain you stop trying to outrun. A platform you never quite leave. Would you believe me if I said the rain feels gentler now? Because some days, it really does.\n\n",

            "content_text": "I am just an average guy. I am not the most talented, the most successful, or the most remarkable person in any room. When I walk into a gathering, I do not command attention. My name does not echo in the corridors of greatness, nor do my actions inspire awe or envy. I exist in the quiet middle ground where expectations are neither sky-high nor rock-bottom. And yet, this is not a lament, nor is it a resignation—it is a simple truth, and one that I have come to embrace.\n\nThe world demands exceptionalism. It tells you that if you are not the best, you are nothing. That to be unnoticed is to be unimportant. But what if that is a lie? What if the true beauty of existence is not in standing apart but in simply being? The extraordinary few dominate history books, but it is the unremarkable many who weave the fabric of the world. A life need not be celebrated to be meaningful.\n\nI have come to appreciate the quiet dignity of being average. In a life not driven by the chase for perfection, there is an odd kind of freedom. I do not feel the weight of the world’s expectations upon my shoulders. I am not shackled by the fear of failure, because I have made peace with the reality that I will fail, as all humans do, but that failure will not make me less. It will not define me. And in that realization, I have found a peculiar kind of peace.\n\nTo be average is to live in a space where life is neither tragedy nor triumph but a constant unfolding of small moments—some wonderful, some painful, all fleeting. I wake up to the same routine, walk the same streets, perform the same tasks, and yet, within these repetitions, I find variation, texture, depth. There is something almost sacred about the ordinariness of a morning coffee, the way steam rises and dances in the light, or how the hum of the city becomes a lullaby if you listen the right way.\n\nWe are taught to believe that significance is tied to recognition. That to matter, we must leave a mark—on people, on places, on history itself. But what if significance does not reside in monuments or accolades? What if it is found in the quiet moments between?\n\nA tree does not seek applause for growing; a river does not measure its worth by how many admire it. And yet, they are. They exist fully, without the need for validation. Is that not enough? If all things, in their simplest form, hold meaning simply by being, then why should I be any different?\n\nWe cling to the idea that we are special, that our experiences are uniquely ours. But step back far enough, and you begin to see the patterns repeating. Countless people have felt the same joys, the same heartbreaks, the same quiet fears. Our struggles are not new; our desires are not original. We are echoes of those who came before us and precursors to those who will follow.\n\nDoes this realization diminish us? Or does it connect us? If I am merely one thread in an infinite tapestry, then I am part of something vast—something greater than myself. Perhaps being indistinct is not a failure but a form of belonging.\n\nModern life inundates us with choices. Every path we take seems to imply that another, better one is slipping away. Success is not just measured by what we achieve, but by what we could have achieved. This is the trap.\n\nSomewhere along the way, the simple act of existing became a competition. People do not simply want to live; they want to live better than others. The question of “Am I happy?” has been replaced with “Am I happier than them?” But what if the pursuit of “better” blinds us to the good that already exists?\n\nThere is poetry in the ordinary, in the unnoticed moments that make up a life. The way the streetlights flicker just before dawn. The sound of leaves rustling on a quiet afternoon. The brief, unspoken understanding exchanged between two strangers who catch each other’s eyes in a crowded place. These are the fragments of life that are so easily overlooked, and yet they form the foundation of our existence.\n\nI once sat in a park and watched a child chase after a balloon. It slipped from his fingers and drifted upward, beyond his reach. He stood still for a moment, staring as it disappeared into the sky. And then, instead of crying, he simply turned back to his game, as if he understood something that we adults often forget: some things are meant to drift away, and that’s okay.\n\nHow often do we mourn the things we lose, believing that their departure diminishes us? But perhaps life is not about clinging but about witnessing. Perhaps the greatest wisdom is in knowing that we are not meant to hold on to everything—that beauty is often in the fleeting.\n\nIn a world obsessed with standing out, choosing to be content in one’s ordinariness is a quiet form of defiance. To resist the pressure to be extraordinary is to reclaim the simple joys that ambition often tramples over.\n\nI choose something different. I choose to be content in my averageness, to relish the simplicity of a life that does not strain to be something it is not. I find joy in small victories—the satisfaction of finishing a book, the comfort of familiar laughter, the way the sky turns to fire in the moments before dusk. I find solace in knowing that I do not need to be remarkable to be real.\n\nPerhaps the most profound truths are found not in grandeur, but in the unnoticed moments between. The way a child absentmindedly hums a tune, the way the wind shifts just before the rain, the way a stranger’s smile lingers for a second longer than expected—these are the fragments of life that matter, that make up the unseen poetry of existence. They are enough.\n\nIn a world that glorifies extremes, there is a quiet strength in embracing the middle. To be average is not to be invisible; it is to be part of the grand, intricate mosaic of existence, where every tile, no matter how plain, contributes to the whole.\n\nI am just an average guy. But I am here. And maybe, just maybe, that is enough.\n\n\n  \n  The Third-Class Carriage (New York) – Honoré Daumier (1862–1864)\n\n",

It had started as a drizzle, tentative, almost hesitant, before settling into a steady downpour. He watched as the droplets traced uncertain paths down the glass, colliding, merging, separating again. There was something hypnotic about it, something familiar.\n\nLately, he had begun to feel as if life itself moved like this—people drifting into each other’s worlds, colliding for a while, then slipping away, sometimes unnoticed. He had told himself it was natural, that this was how things worked. People came, people went. We grew, we changed, we moved on. It was just the order of things.\n\nAnd yet, some part of him remained unsettled. There were moments, quiet and unguarded, when he wondered if moving forward always had to mean leaving people behind.\n\nHe had spent years becoming someone different, someone better. Or at least, that was what he told himself. He had outgrown things—the insecurities of youth, the need for validation, the desperate longing to belong. He had learned not to rely on others too much, not to expect them to stay. He had taught himself to be whole on his own.\n\nAnd yet, in doing so, had he unknowingly built a life where no one needed to stay?\n\nAs we grow—mentally, emotionally, in the ways the world defines success—we begin to reshape our surroundings. We prune. We refine. We tell ourselves that we are choosing what serves us best. Friendships that once felt like lifelines become distant memories. People who once mattered deeply become passing figures in the background of our lives. And it’s not that we forget them completely—it’s just that, somehow, we convince ourselves they were not meant to be permanent.\n\nWe categorize, we justify. Some people, we decide, are simply not the ones. Not the ones we seek comfort from, not the ones we expect to understand us, not the ones we turn to in our moments of quiet sorrow. And so, without ever saying it out loud, we stop looking for them. We stop seeing them at all.\n\nIt is an easy thing to do, to frame the past in a way that makes our choices seem inevitable. We tell ourselves that the people we left behind were not meant for the versions of us that exist now. That they could not have walked this far with us, that they lacked the depth, the growth, the understanding. And in that belief, we find a quiet kind of solace, a reassurance that we were right to move forward without them.\n\nBut is it always true?\n\nHe thought of old conversations, old promises. He thought of the people who had once mattered beyond measure—their laughter, their words, the quiet, unspoken understanding that had once existed. Had they truly changed so much? Had he? Or had he simply chosen to believe they no longer belonged in his world?\n\nThere was something unsettling about the realization that growth could also be a kind of forgetting. That self-sufficiency, when taken too far, could turn into isolation. That sometimes, in our attempt to become better, we lose sight of what once made us whole.\n\nTonight, in the hush of his apartment, he let himself sit with the discomfort. The rain had slowed, the rhythm against the window now softer, gentler. He picked up his phone, scrolling through names—some familiar, some long untouched. His thumb hovered for a moment before he finally, hesitantly, pressed down.\n\nMaybe moving forward didn’t always have to mean leaving everything behind.

            "content_text": "The house breathed in slow whispers. Even in the afternoon, when the sunlight slanted through the wooden slats of the old windows, the corners remained untouched by light, gathering dust and silence. At night, the air thickened, pressing against the walls, curling into the folds of the mosquito net, pooling beneath the bed. Outside, the distant call of a train, the rustle of palm leaves against the neighbor’s tin shed, the occasional bark of a street dog—all familiar sounds, yet each one carried the weight of something unseen.\n\nShe had always known the darkness differently from others. It did not merely exist; it watched, it waited. Stepping out of the room at night was not as simple as placing one foot in front of the other. The corridor stretched impossibly long, the switchboard an eternity away. Somewhere beyond the darkness lay the bathroom, the kitchen with its cold cement floor, the verandah where her mother had once sat, cutting vegetables in the late afternoon. But to reach them meant crossing through the shadows, and some nights, it was easier to stay still, to let discomfort settle in like an unwanted guest.\n\nThe house was never empty, yet silence clung to it like the scent of old incense. Conversations had been reduced to necessities—tea is on the table, the gas cylinder is empty, Dida’s blood pressure is high again. Beyond that, words felt cumbersome. The radio still played old Bangla songs in the afternoons, Kishore Kumar’s voice slipping between rooms like an echo of something once whole, now fractured. Her father spent more time staring out of the window than reading his newspaper. Her mother’s hands never stopped moving—kneading dough, folding saris, adjusting the wick of the lamp before evening pujo. The rhythms remained unchanged, mechanical, like the sound of a ceiling fan that had been running too long.\n\nTears came too easily. She had learned to turn her face away at the slightest tremor in her throat, to press her nails into her palm under the dining table, to hold her breath until the moment passed. There was no space for weakness in a house like this. When had she first learned that? Perhaps the day her mother had told her, “Chhoto chhoto kothay chokher jol niye boshle chhotoi thakis”—if you cry over small things, you will always remain small. She had nodded then, but the words had never left her.\n\nIt was safer to keep quiet. People asked too many questions, expected too many things. How do you explain to someone that your mind feels like an old house left unkempt, that the windows are too dusty to let in the sun? How do you tell them that you push people away not because you want to, but because you are afraid of what you might leave behind in them? She had once read about a forest where trees never touched, their branches stopping just short of each other. Crown shyness, it was called. She had carried the term with her ever since.\n\nGoing outside felt unnecessary. The world beyond the grilled balcony was loud, chaotic—buses honking past Gariahat, shopkeepers calling out their prices in rhythmic chants, the weight of too many people moving with too much purpose. Even in the market, where her mother used to take her as a child, she had always clung to the edge of her saree, wary of the press of bodies, the overwhelming smell of fish laid out on beds of melting ice. She had learned early that she did not belong to the world the way others did.\n\nSleep came in long, uneven stretches. Some mornings, she woke up with the heaviness of dreams she could not recall. The bed was warm, familiar, the ceiling unchanged, but something within her felt misplaced, like an object left in the wrong room. She stayed in bed long past the first call of the muriwala outside, past the clatter of utensils from the kitchen, past the scent of cardamom rising from the first cup of tea.\n\nThe days folded into each other. The walls of the house knew her well—had memorized the shape of her silences, the weight of her footsteps. The city moved on without her, the seasons changed, but here, inside, everything remained the same. It was easier that way.\n\nAnd yet, one night, the storm came. The monsoon wind rushed through the half-open window, rattling the glass panes, carrying in the thick, earthy scent of wet soil. The rain did not hesitate—it crashed against the tin roof, spilled over the balcony, soaked the clothes left hanging outside. She sat up, listening. The room was dark, but the outside world had come alive in a way she had long forgotten.\n\nShe stood up. The air smelled of something she could not name—something old, something waiting.\n\nShe walked to the door.\n\nThe hallway stretched before her, shadowed but familiar. The light switch was still far. The wind howled through the gaps in the window, the darkness pulsed, but for once, she did not stop.\n\n\n  “कोई उम्मीद बर नहीं आती, कोई सूरत नज़र नहीं आती,\nमौत का एक दिन मुअय्यन है, नींद क्यों रात भर नहीं आती?”\n \n \n—Mirza Ghalib\n\n\n\n🎵\n\n\n",

The wind howled through the gaps in the window, the darkness pulsed, but for once, she did not stop.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>“कोई उम्मीद बर नहीं आती, कोई सूरत नज़र नहीं आती,<br />\nमौत का एक दिन मुअय्यन है, नींद क्यों रात भर नहीं आती?”</strong><br />\n<!-- > **\"کویٔ امید بر نہیں آتی، کویٔ صورت نظر نہیں آتی،  \nموت کا ایک دن معین ہے، نیند کیوں رات بھر نہیں آتی؟\"**  --> \n<!-- > **\"No hope seems to arise, no face appears before me,  \nDeath is destined for a single day, why then does sleep not come all night?\"**  --> \n—Mirza Ghalib</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/8AHCfZTRGiI\">🎵</a>\n</p>\n\n",
