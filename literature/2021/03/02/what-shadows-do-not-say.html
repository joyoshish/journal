  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The house breathed in slow whispers. Even in the afternoon, when the sunlight slanted through the wooden slats of the old windows, the corners remained untouched by light, gathering dust and silence. At night, the air thickened, pressing against the walls, curling into the folds of the mosquito net, pooling beneath the bed. Outside, the distant call of a train, the rustle of palm leaves against the neighbor‚Äôs tin shed, the occasional bark of a street dog‚Äîall familiar sounds, yet each one carried the weight of something unseen.</p>

<p>She had always known the darkness differently from others. It did not merely exist; it watched, it waited. Stepping out of the room at night was not as simple as placing one foot in front of the other. The corridor stretched impossibly long, the switchboard an eternity away. Somewhere beyond the darkness lay the bathroom, the kitchen with its cold cement floor, the verandah where her mother had once sat, cutting vegetables in the late afternoon. But to reach them meant crossing through the shadows, and some nights, it was easier to stay still, to let discomfort settle in like an unwanted guest.</p>

<p>The house was never empty, yet silence clung to it like the scent of old incense. Conversations had been reduced to necessities‚Äîtea is on the table, the gas cylinder is empty, Dida‚Äôs blood pressure is high again. Beyond that, words felt cumbersome. The radio still played old Bangla songs in the afternoons, Kishore Kumar‚Äôs voice slipping between rooms like an echo of something once whole, now fractured. Her father spent more time staring out of the window than reading his newspaper. Her mother‚Äôs hands never stopped moving‚Äîkneading dough, folding saris, adjusting the wick of the lamp before evening pujo. The rhythms remained unchanged, mechanical, like the sound of a ceiling fan that had been running too long.</p>

<p>Tears came too easily. She had learned to turn her face away at the slightest tremor in her throat, to press her nails into her palm under the dining table, to hold her breath until the moment passed. There was no space for weakness in a house like this. When had she first learned that? Perhaps the day her mother had told her, ‚ÄúChhoto chhoto kothay chokher jol niye boshle chhotoi thakis‚Äù‚Äîif you cry over small things, you will always remain small. She had nodded then, but the words had never left her.</p>

<p>It was safer to keep quiet. People asked too many questions, expected too many things. How do you explain to someone that your mind feels like an old house left unkempt, that the windows are too dusty to let in the sun? How do you tell them that you push people away not because you want to, but because you are afraid of what you might leave behind in them? She had once read about a forest where trees never touched, their branches stopping just short of each other. <em>Crown shyness,</em> it was called. She had carried the term with her ever since.</p>

<p>Going outside felt unnecessary. The world beyond the grilled balcony was loud, chaotic‚Äîbuses honking past Gariahat, shopkeepers calling out their prices in rhythmic chants, the weight of too many people moving with too much purpose. Even in the market, where her mother used to take her as a child, she had always clung to the edge of her saree, wary of the press of bodies, the overwhelming smell of fish laid out on beds of melting ice. She had learned early that she did not belong to the world the way others did.</p>

<p>Sleep came in long, uneven stretches. Some mornings, she woke up with the heaviness of dreams she could not recall. The bed was warm, familiar, the ceiling unchanged, but something within her felt misplaced, like an object left in the wrong room. She stayed in bed long past the first call of the muriwala outside, past the clatter of utensils from the kitchen, past the scent of cardamom rising from the first cup of tea.</p>

<p>The days folded into each other. The walls of the house knew her well‚Äîhad memorized the shape of her silences, the weight of her footsteps. The city moved on without her, the seasons changed, but here, inside, everything remained the same. It was easier that way.</p>

<p>And yet, one night, the storm came. The monsoon wind rushed through the half-open window, rattling the glass panes, carrying in the thick, earthy scent of wet soil. The rain did not hesitate‚Äîit crashed against the tin roof, spilled over the balcony, soaked the clothes left hanging outside. She sat up, listening. The room was dark, but the outside world had come alive in a way she had long forgotten.</p>

<p>She stood up. The air smelled of something she could not name‚Äîsomething old, something waiting.</p>

<p>She walked to the door.</p>

<p>The hallway stretched before her, shadowed but familiar. The light switch was still far. The wind howled through the gaps in the window, the darkness pulsed, but for once, she did not stop.</p>
