      The Absence We Ignore
    </h1>
  

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The rain had been falling for hours, a quiet, relentless rhythm against the window. It had started as a drizzle, tentative, almost hesitant, before settling into a steady downpour. He watched as the droplets traced uncertain paths down the glass, colliding, merging, separating again. There was something hypnotic about it, something familiar.</p>

<p>Lately, he had begun to feel as if life itself moved like this—people drifting into each other’s worlds, colliding for a while, then slipping away, sometimes unnoticed. He had told himself it was natural, that this was how things worked. People came, people went. We grew, we changed, we moved on. It was just the order of things.</p>

<p>And yet, some part of him remained unsettled. There were moments, quiet and unguarded, when he wondered if moving forward always had to mean leaving people behind.</p>

<p>He had spent years becoming someone different, someone better. Or at least, that was what he told himself. He had outgrown things—the insecurities of youth, the need for validation, the desperate longing to belong. He had learned not to rely on others too much, not to expect them to stay. He had taught himself to be whole on his own.</p>

<p>And yet, in doing so, had he unknowingly built a life where no one <em>needed</em> to stay?</p>

<p>As we grow—mentally, emotionally, in the ways the world defines success—we begin to reshape our surroundings. We prune. We refine. We tell ourselves that we are choosing what serves us best. Friendships that once felt like lifelines become distant memories. People who once mattered deeply become passing figures in the background of our lives. And it’s not that we forget them completely—it’s just that, somehow, we convince ourselves they were not meant to be permanent.</p>

<p>We categorize, we justify. Some people, we decide, are simply <em>not the ones</em>. Not the ones we seek comfort from, not the ones we expect to understand us, not the ones we turn to in our moments of quiet sorrow. And so, without ever saying it out loud, we stop looking for them. We stop seeing them at all.</p>

<p>It is an easy thing to do, to frame the past in a way that makes our choices seem inevitable. We tell ourselves that the people we left behind were not meant for the versions of us that exist now. That they could not have walked this far with us, that they lacked the depth, the growth, the understanding. And in that belief, we find a quiet kind of solace, a reassurance that we were <em>right</em> to move forward without them.</p>

<p>But is it always true?</p>

<p>He thought of old conversations, old promises. He thought of the people who had once mattered beyond measure—their laughter, their words, the quiet, unspoken understanding that had once existed. Had they truly changed so much? Had he? Or had he simply chosen to believe they no longer belonged in his world?</p>

<p>There was something unsettling about the realization that growth could also be a kind of forgetting. That self-sufficiency, when taken too far, could turn into isolation. That sometimes, in our attempt to become better, we lose sight of what once made us whole.</p>

<p>Tonight, in the hush of his apartment, he let himself sit with the discomfort. The rain had slowed, the rhythm against the window now softer, gentler. He picked up his phone, scrolling through names—some familiar, some long untouched. His thumb hovered for a moment before he finally, hesitantly, pressed down.</p>

<p>Maybe moving forward didn’t always have to mean leaving everything behind. Maybe, just maybe, some doors were never meant to be closed.</p>
